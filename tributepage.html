      <h2>Pre-Series</h2>
      <p>Originally from Oklahoma, Bishop is presumably the youngest of four children born to an unnamed father and Barbara Bishop with Bishop's three older brothers named George, John and Robert.
      </p>
      <p>At some point, possibly after graduating from high school, Bishop applied to join NCIS but the application was not returned. She later joined the NSA instead and became an analyst with Bishop being assigned to examine the Middle East and determine
        any potential threats.
      </p>
      <p>With her mission being preemptive terror analysis where she had to predict and also pinpoint who the up and coming threats were, Bishop became the first person to officially recognize terrorist Benham Parsa as a potential threat. She then devoted
        six years of her NSA career to hunting Parsa with Bishop's determination to find Parsa slowly becoming an obsession.
      </p>
      <p>Fearing for her, Bishop's superiors forcibly removed her from the case.
      </p>
      <p>While there, Bishop also wrote a paper in which she theorized about how a high-profile government target could become an unwitting mole if given an inconspicuous item that had a bug in it.
      </p>
      <h2>Occupation</h2>
      <p>Prior to joining NCIS, Bishop worked as an analyst for the NSA- National Security Agency although when she first began working at NSA remains unknown.
      </p>
      <p>She later joined NCIS, first as an liaison officer to NCIS via NSA before being promoted to NCIS Probationary Agent, a position she holds to this day.
      </p>
      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>Bishop has shoulder-length light, blonde hair and brown eyes as well as fair skin.
      </p>
      <p>In her first appearance in <a href="http://ncis.wikia.com/wiki/Gut_Check_(episode)" title="Gut Check (episode)">Gut Check (episode)</a>, Bishop wore a woolen jumper and slightly torn jeans with holes visible in them as well as brown boots.
      </p>
      <p>Since joining NCIS as a Liaison between NCIS and NSA and eventually as a full-time NCIS Special Agent, Bishop has continued wearing numerous clothing including jackets, jeans, trousers and boots.
      </p>
      <p>Whenever she is out in the field, Bishop wears the traditional NCIS windbreaker or coat while also donning the NCIS cap.
      </p>
      <p>She also ties her hair up and like her predecessors, places her own hair which is often tied up into a bun directly under the cap itself so that it sticks out at the end of the cap.
      </p>
      <p>Like her colleagues, Bishop wears a holster containing her SIG-Sauer and similarly to Gibbs and Tony, Bishop also wears the holster and her NCIS badge on her right hip.
      </p>
      <p>Similarly to Agent <a href="http://ncis.wikia.com/wiki/Timothy_McGee" title="Timothy McGee">Timothy McGee</a>, former NCIS Director <a href="http://ncis.wikia.com/wiki/Jennifer_Shepard" title="Jennifer Shepard">Jennifer Shepard</a>, and OSP Technical
        Analyst <a href="http://ncis.wikia.com/wiki/Nell_Jones" title="Nell Jones">Nell Jones</a>, Bishop wears her watch on her right wrist and like Shepard and Jones, Bishop is right-handed while McGee is left-handed.
      </p>
      <p>When she first joined the team, Bishop was seen wearing her wedding ring which traditionally rests on the index finger of the wearer's left hand but she has stopped wearing it now that she and Jake are divorced.
      </p>
      <h2>Abilities</h2>
      <p>As an NSA analyst, Bishop was originally trained to determine possible threats and also break any possibly encrypted information.
      </p>
      <p>Now an NCIS Special Agent, Bishop has undergone training, enabling her to use her NSA skills in conjunction with the skills associated with an NCIS agent including processing crime scenes as well as arresting and interrogating any and all possible
        suspects.
